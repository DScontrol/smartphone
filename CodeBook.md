This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data called.

## Id Fields
Each entry contains two identifiers:

* `subject` - The ID of the subject that makes the test
* `activity` - The type of activity performed by the subject

## Activities Labels
Each entry corresponds to a certain activity done by the subject during the test. This are the activities availables:

* `1.WALKING`: subject was walking 
* `2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking up a staircase 
* `3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking down a staircase 
* `4.SITTING`: subject was sitting 
* `5.STANDING`: subject was standing 
* `6.LAYING`: subject was laying down 

## Measurements
Each feature has been relabelled for using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
This transformations has been done:

* `1`.All the expresions "-mean()" has been replaced by "Mean"
* `2`.All the expresions "-std()" has been replaced by "Std"
* `3`.All the expresions "[-()]" has been replaced by ""

The list of the features is this:
